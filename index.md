## Welcome to ATS on GitHub Pages

This site is a front end for development work by All Things Sound.

ATS has only just acquired a GitHub account but has previously completed a couple of coding projects. This page can, therefore, serve as an introduction to what is already available. If you're interested, you can also see our [main website](http://www.allthingssound.co.uk) which describes the main work in which we're involved.

### Daily Bible Readings

This is a simple, browser-based application designed to help the user follow a daily bible reading routine that will cover the entire Bible in one year, or spread over a three-year period. It includes daily links to popular, online versions of the Bible and to additional resources such as Bible Dictionaries, Commentaries and an Atlas.

You can see this project [here](https://github.com/lochmanpaul/bible_readings).
